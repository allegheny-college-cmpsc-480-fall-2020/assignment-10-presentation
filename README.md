# CMPSC 480: Assignment 10, presentation
* Point value: 200 pts.
* Due: Various (see below)

## Overview
 
Now that your portfolio and semester are, effectively, complete, this assignment asks you to reflect on the narrative you've started to create for yourself. In this presentation, you'll think about the relationship of various decisions made during the semester including those made while creating professional documents and design decisions which impact your portfolio project. Think of this presentation as more than merely showing off your work; in many ways this is your opportunity to demonstrate the professional identity you want to have.

### Requirements

- [ ] A title slide with your name and a short tag line
- [ ] Discussion/revision of your developer narrative and how it has changed throughout the semester
- [ ] A list and description of various opportunities that you've found or applied for
  * In particular, how do they make sense in the context of your narrative
- [ ] Demonstration of your portfolio site, featuring:
  * A description of your audience
  * Decisions made in design or content which speak to that audience
- [ ] Projection of how you would like your career (academic or professional) to proceed after this course
  * I leave the timeline here vague to let you define how far out you'd like to project
- [ ] One (or more) point of advice you'd give your fellow classmates or future students beginning this journey

### Deliverable
